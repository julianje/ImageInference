# Social inferences from physical evidence

Project repository for the paper, "Social inferences from physical evidence via Bayesian event reconstruction" [link](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/xge0001182).

## Repository structure

- *analysis*: Contains the R code to generate all results and figures reported in the paper (see our (OSF)[https://osf.io/q3ct5/] for a more slim version)
- *data*: Contains the raw and preprocessed human data, as well as the model predictions and visualizations of these model predictions
- *experiments*: Contains the code for generating the web experiments
- *models*: Contains the Python code for generating the model predictions for each task
- *stimuli*: Contains the stimuli used in the web experiments
- *utils*: Contains miscellaneous scripts for preprocessing data and updating model parameters

## Setup

To get started, you will need the following packages:
- Bishop (see installation instructions [here](https://github.com/julianje/Bishop); requires Python 3)
-
